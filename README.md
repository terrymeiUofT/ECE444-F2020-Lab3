### Activity 3
The Flask context globals include 4 variables for 2 contexts in Flask -- the application context and request context. Each context has 2 vairaibles to help achieve its functions, such as temporary storage of information. Attempt to access these variables in wrong contexts would result in errors. In this way, these variables ensure the data integrity in Flask.
